Here are some test pages that i can test the toy browser against.

- Cern
They use lots of tags but most aren't supported or defined (including on modern web browsers).
We need to still get the text from such things (including inside of body).

We also need to support links as those are nested. I do have an idea for that though.

- Simple test
This is basically just a picture (PNG file with alpha transparency) and some text below.
My HTML renderer can already render this almost perfectly.

- Acid1
The infamous CSS test page.
This will take some time to support properly...
If you are curious, Netsurf renders it properly.
I won't even consider acid2 until it gets that right.

- Simple test 2
This is a harder test that sets the background color via CSS, does some quirks
that we need to support for proper look and the center tag that we need to support.
(Might not be trivial to support)

	째 Implement text warping (according to the screen width)
	If text goes outside the screen width, it warps around.

	째 Image next to text
	In our case, the text is at the very bottom of image in terms of height but right next to it.

	째 Support for <center> tag
	For basic support, just a matter of setting the default X value according to our screen resolution and the text width.
	This will not work however if say, text is in body and they use br after.

	째 Support for <br> tag
	See above, we would have to support all sorts of edge cases.


- Netscape order
An order page from the late 90s. I picked that one as it had no javascript.

- ViolaWWW review
A simple test with lots of ul/li lists, links and spaces.
If we can support that then we can pretty much support most of the early pages.
